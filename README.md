- **SQL + Python analysis** ‚Üí KPIs and data diagnostics  
- **Interactive dashboard** ‚Üí Streamlit app to explore results  
- **One-click orchestration** ‚Üí Automated project runner (`run_project.bat`)

> **Note**: `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`, and `outputs/` are **not included** in the repo because they are too large. Add them locally after cloning.
